# hello-world
In this file, I am emulating the process of fixing a bug. But I don't really have any code, so
instead I am editing this file. I created a new branch and called it 'bug-22194' as if that
were a real bug. Then I added this text to the file in order to get used to using GitHub. So
far, so good!

We received bug-2, which said that I should add a second paragraph. Here's a second paragraph,
which means I should be able to close this big and move on to a sunny tomorrow!
